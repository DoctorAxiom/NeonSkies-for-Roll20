This is a fan port of the neon skies character sheet for Roll20 use. If you are William Buchanan or an associate of William Buchanan and do not wish for any of the material here to be used, please contact me. I have restricted hosted items to fair use items ( my own art renditions which are similar to your icons ) rather than republishing any material within your sourcebooks. I'm also just happy to sign over the rights of this to you if it helps- I just wanted to be able to play Neon Skies on Roll20.
